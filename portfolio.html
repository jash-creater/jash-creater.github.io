        <p> Project 1 is a personal blog website that I built from scratch. It features a clean and responsive design, allowing me to share my thoughts, experiences, and hobbies with the world. I used HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to create this project. The blog includes categories, tags, and a comment section for engaging with readers.
